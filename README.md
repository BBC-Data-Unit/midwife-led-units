In December we [reported that one in four women are transferred from midwife-led units to consultants because of complications when giving birth](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37471091).

The story was based on Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to hospital trusts. 128 of 139 trusts responded. 

We also spoke to the Birth Trauma Association, The Royal College of Midwives (RCM), the head of midwifery at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, NHS England, and a number of women who had given birth in midwife-led units.

## Data
