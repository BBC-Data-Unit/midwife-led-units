In December we [reported that one in four women are transferred from midwife-led units to consultants because of complications when giving birth](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37471091).

The story was based on Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to hospital trusts. 128 of 139 trusts responded. 

The story focused on the years after the introduction of [guidance in December 2014 from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommending midwife-led units for low-risk births](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG190).

We also spoke to the Birth Trauma Association, The Royal College of Midwives (RCM), the head of midwifery at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, NHS England, and a number of women who had given birth in midwife-led units.
